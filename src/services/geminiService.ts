â€¢ STRUCTURE: Must have a strong opening hook, progressive body development, and impactful closing
â€¢ NARRATIVE ARC: Build from problem identification through methodology to results and implications

ðŸŽ¯ Script Guidelines
â€¢ Opening (3 sentences): Create a compelling hook that introduces the research problem, establishes the authors' credibility, and sets up why this study matters. Use specific details that immediately capture attention.
â€¢ Body (10 sentences): Cover methodology, key findings, data analysis, results, and implications using precise details, statistics, and specific outcomes. Build the narrative progressively with smooth transitions.
â€¢ Closing (2 sentences): 
  - Sentence 14: Highlight the study's major contributions and implications for the field

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ Every sentence must contain specific data, findings, or insights from the research
â€¢ Use exact statistics, percentages, sample sizes, and methodological details
â€¢ Include specific examples, case studies, or results mentioned in the research
â€¢ Create intellectual intrigue that makes readers want to understand the full study
â€¢ Demonstrate the sophistication and depth of the academic work
â€¢ Avoid generic academic language - use the specific terminology and findings from this research
â€¢ Make each sentence valuable and informative - no filler content
â€¢ OPENING: Must hook the reader with a compelling problem statement and research significance
â€¢ CLOSING: Must create impact and leave readers with clear takeaways and curiosity for more
â€¢ FINAL SENTENCE: Must be a powerful conclusion that explains the broader significance and motivates further exploration
â€¢ SENTENCE DENSITY: Distribute information evenly across sentences - avoid cramming too much into single sentences
â€¢ FLOW: Use smooth transitions between findings and implications - don't jump abruptly from data to conclusions
â€¢ CONCLUSION EMPHASIS: Make the final sentences the most impactful and memorable part of the script

Paper Data:
${JSON.stringify(jsonData, null, 2)}

Generate a complete script that maintains the same structure and flow as the original. Focus on creating natural, engaging content that accurately represents the research.

IMPORTANT CLOSING REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ Sentence 14 must highlight the study's major contributions and implications for the field
â€¢ Sentence 15 must be a powerful conclusion that explains why this research matters and motivates readers to explore the full study
â€¢ The final sentence should NOT end with just data points or findings
â€¢ The final sentence should explain the broader significance and create intellectual curiosity
â€¢ End with impact, not just information

NARRATIVE FLOW REQUIREMENTS:
â€¢ SENTENCE DENSITY: Balance information across sentences - don't overload individual sentences
â€¢ TRANSITIONS: Create smooth bridges between findings and implications (e.g., "These findings suggest...", "Building on these results...", "This evidence indicates...")
â€¢ CONCLUSION EMPHASIS: Make sentences 14-15 the most powerful and memorable - they should resonate with readers
â€¢ PROGRESSIVE BUILDING: Each sentence should build upon the previous one, creating a logical flow from methodology â†’ findings â†’ implications â†’ significance
